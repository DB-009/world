# Development Roadmap: Basic Farming

## Basic Farming & Survival ðŸŒ±

**Simple Loop**: Plant â†’ Wait â†’ Harvest â†’ Eat

- [ ] **Plant Seeds**: Right-click dirt tiles to plant, use existing crop sprites
- [ ] **Auto Growth**: Crops grow automatically after 3-5 minutes OR implement simple day/night cycle
- [ ] **Harvest**: Right-click mature crops to collect food
- [ ] **Hunger Bar**: Health bar decreases over time, eating restores it
- [ ] **Game Over**: Character dies when hunger reaches zero
- [ ] **UI Elements**: Hunger bar, food counter, simple inventory

Focus on core single-player survival mechanics with farming gameplay.
