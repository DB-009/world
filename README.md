Hello! I’m creating a browser-based pixel art colony sim (Rimworld-inspired) and need a JavaScript/TypeScript developer to build the MVP. Experience with Phaser, PixiJS, or a similar framework is required, along with:

- **Core systems:**  
  - Procedural ground map generation  
  - A controllable character that moves with WASD keys, using both idle and running animations from the asset pack  
- **Pixel art integration:**  
  - Use the “Little Dreamyland Asset Pack” (https://starmixu.itch.io/little-dreamyland-asset-pack) for sprites, tiles, and animations  

**Responsibilities:**  
- Review design docs and implement a prototype featuring:  
  - A procedurally generated ground map (grid-based tiles sourced from the asset pack)  
  - A character that moves with WASD keys, using idle and running animations from the asset pack  

**Compensation:**  
- $20–$40/hr (negotiable) or fixed-fee milestones. Potential for ongoing work.

**Timeline:**  
- Immediate start. MVP completion in 1 week.

**Submission:**  
- Completed MVP should be submitted as a pull request to https://github.com/super3/world
